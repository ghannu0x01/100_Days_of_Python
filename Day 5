##Escape Sequence Characters:
To insert characters that cannot be directly used in a string, we use an escape sequence characters.

An escape sequence character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of a character that cannot be directly used in string is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
print("This doesnt "execute")
print("This will \" execute")
